## High Priority

* Get item details on `<Card />` click
* Implement pagination for the scroll panels
* Serve up different image quality based on device size / network / available cores / battery level

## Medium Priority

* Implement service worker to cache certain files to work offline
* Implement proper local storage caching to view recent searches offline

## Low Priority

* Improve UI

## Fun Extras

* Use the `navigator` API to inform users if they go offline / online
* Create custom toasts for the above
* Inform users if they are on low battery (change image size based on this)
